# ctf-skills

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) for solving CTF challenges — web exploitation, binary pwn, crypto, reverse engineering, forensics, OSINT, and more. Works with any tool that supports the Agent Skills spec, including [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add ljagiello/ctf-skills
```

## Run with Friday Studio

Want these skills as part of a real workflow — schedules, signals, MCP tools, memory, the works? Drop them into [Friday](https://hellofriday.ai/), the shareable AI workspace runtime from [Tempest Labs](https://hellofriday.ai/).

Friday Studio loads skills into agent context on demand and runs them inside reproducible workspaces that you can trigger from chat, on a cron, or over HTTP. Everything runs locally, your data stays on your machine, and every step is logged so you can see exactly what the agent did during a challenge.

To add these skills to Friday Studio:

1. Install Friday from [hellofriday.ai](https://hellofriday.ai/) (macOS).
2. Open **Skills** in the Studio sidebar and click **+ Add**.
3. Import individual skills by reference (e.g. `ljagiello/ctf-skills/ctf-web`), or upload this repo as a folder.
4. Reference them from any `workspace.yml`, or let agents load them automatically based on the skill description.

See the [Friday Skills docs](https://docs.hellofriday.ai/core-concepts/skills) for the full workflow, and the [Friday blog](https://blog.hellofriday.ai/) — including [AI Drift: The Hidden Cost of Building with AI](https://blog.hellofriday.ai/ai-drift-the-hidden-cost-of-building-with-ai-e2b51415b3b0) — for the philosophy behind it.

## Environment Setup

Two setup strategies depending on your workflow:

### Pre-install (recommended before competitions)

Use the central installer entrypoint:

```bash
bash scripts/install_ctf_tools.sh all
```

Run a narrower mode when you only want one tool group:

```bash
bash scripts/install_ctf_tools.sh python
bash scripts/install_ctf_tools.sh pat
bash scripts/install_ctf_tools.sh apt
bash scripts/install_ctf_tools.sh brew
bash scripts/install_ctf_tools.sh gems
bash scripts/install_ctf_tools.sh go
bash scripts/install_ctf_tools.sh manual
```

Preview what would be installed (skips already-present packages):

```bash
bash scripts/install_ctf_tools.sh --dry-run all
```

Verify what's already installed:

```bash
bash scripts/install_ctf_tools.sh --verify
```

Use `--force` to reinstall everything regardless of what's already present. Install logs are saved to `~/.ctf-tools/`.

The full package lists now live in [scripts/install_ctf_tools.sh](scripts/install_ctf_tools.sh).

> [!TIP]
> The `pat` mode shallow-clones [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) into `~/.ctf-tools/PayloadsAllTheThings` and links it at `ctf-web/payloads/PayloadsAllTheThings`. Bulk payloads stay out of git; technique files reference `ctf-web/pat-reference.md` with a few exemplar payloads inline.

### On-demand (during challenges)

Each skill's `SKILL.md` has a **Prerequisites** section listing only the tools needed for that category. Install as you go when the agent encounters a missing tool.
